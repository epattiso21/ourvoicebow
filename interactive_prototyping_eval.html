							<p>Many of the design changes we implemented were based on our user feedback from the review session. For ease of navigation, we created a bottom navigation bar similar to the first design, but with the addition of a groups section. At the top of the page, we decided to move the location of notifications from the original design. While they used to be under the triple bar feature, bringing them to the upper-righthand corner gave users easier access to their notifications. As this is an important feature users would likely use a lot, we used a corner space as it is very easy to navigate to. Lastly, under settings, users have the option to make multiple accounts and switch between them, similar to other social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. This would enable a leader of multiple organizations to create a personal account and several organization accounts. Overall, we felt that these design changes would maintain external consistency, as the placement of the features were similar to other prominent platforms and websites.</p>
							<p>Two “risky” interactions of our design include our mind map and our search feature. For the mind map, user errors may be common because it is a relatively unique feature and consists of many internal components that may be confusing. For example, the mind map allows users to add resources and organizations to a specific topic, which could make the map quite large. This could also be a difficult feature to implement in regards to online security, as opening up the option for users to interact could raise privacy concerns. Additionally, verifying an organization may be a difficult task, as some users could create fake organization accounts and post inaccurate information. To combat this issue, we would take a similar approach to the method Instagram uses, in which Instagram reviews the verified account based on the provided verification criteria. This is checked through our verification process.  Organization accounts must be verified to post events and action items and must be well-known entities to be verified. Unverified organizations can still participate by sharing resources and creating groups. This allows organizations to see what the app is like before they officially join.</p>

							<br><h3>InVision Prototype Design Rationale</h3>
							<p>As our biggest point of feedback from user testing was improving learnability, we ensured that our interface was externally and internally consistent in terms of color scheme, signifiers, font. etc. We also made use of Gestalt principles like common region, similarity, and proximity to ensure that our app was void of any visual clutter that may distract the user. In terms of graphic design, our main icons (e.g. home, notifications, profile, triple bar) were simplistic and universally understandable, which made the interface easy to navigate. On the other hand, the fun aspects of our app, like badges and issue pins, were visually appealing and colorful to encourage users to continue using our application. Also on the student profile page and sign-up page where the users select issues of interest, we used beautiful, dynamic, and cohesive images to further draw the students in, which is also suitable for the user age group. Also, by including these exciting and diverse images, they call attention to the fact that the app offers a breadth of issues to get involved in and care about. For instance, the badge that represents the environment is an image of Earth with trees growing on top and out of the confines of the usual button, which reinforces the uniqueness of each issue. </p>
							<p>For color, we decided to go with a monochrome palette of navy blue, white, and light blue. Blue is not only a very popular color, but invokes a sense of serenity that is not often found when discussing politics online. According to color psychology, navy blue captures a sense of factual logic, trust, and authority. As false information is prevalent online, especially within the political sphere, we wanted the colors to show the user that they can trust our app as an authority. Also, as blue is a popular color for many websites like Facebook and Twitter, we wanted to make sure our blue was distinct from these apps. Distinguishing the blue in our app from others is especially important, as we want our app to be a separate space for the user from other social media platforms. In terms of readability, the light blue and navy blue contrast well, but also aren’t completely opposites in contrast, which would make reading easy on the users’ eyes. We also made sure to avoid using pure blue for text, lines, and small shapes, as the center of the retina lacks blue cones. Finally, our palette serves as good base colors that would mesh well with the array of colorful badges and icons we added.</p>
							<p>For typography, we went with an informal, fun looking font called Noteworthy. While the font has a playful appeal, it is also quite readable, and is even one of the main fonts used in the Notes app on Apple devices. Furthermore, it has similar characteristics to Comic Sans in that there are larger irregularities between each letter, which makes the typeface dyslexia friendly. However, Noteworthy is slightly thinner and differs in stroke throughout each letter, which gives it a more elegant appearance than Comic Sans, which makes the interface look cleaner and more professional. In addition, one of the key aspects of our app is that it motivates people and the community to promote change. With an almost handwritten font, the app feels like a grassroots political campaign, coming straight from the people, not from large companies or establishments. Also, it conveys a sense of youthfulness that meets the intended age of our users, it will improve user satisfaction. </p>
							<p>Lastly, we incorporated user testing feedback into our design. During user testing, our search feature caused some initial confusion, which was due to the low-fidelity prototype not fully being able to replicate the interaction we had intended. For this high-fidelity prototype, we added more screens with a keyboard, in-progress text, and filter buttons that changed color once clicked, which would closely reflect interactions made on the phone. Another issue we ran into during user testing was confusion over the multiple share buttons. In our new design, we condensed them into a single share button, which then led the user to a pop-up with more options upon clicking. We also made use of signifiers such as the “plus” next to the profile picture, “Edit Details” label, and “Read Now” label, which were designed to offer better guidance on how to navigate the interface.</p>

							<br><h3>Heuristic Design Evaluation Takeaways</h3>
							<p>We found many useful insights from our peer heuristic design evaluations. Positive feedback included the overall organization, the professional feel of the color scheme and design, the separation between the student and organizer accounts, and the dynamic page where users pick what issues they are the most interested in. We also got a lot of constructive feedback. For instance, one of the biggest takeaways was that there was still a continued misunderstanding of the functionality of the mind map despite the added instructional page. Users found editing the mindmap to be confusing and that the space was used inefficiently. From this feedback, we redesigned the mindmap to have a more organized workflow, with all of the tabs leading from an origin on the left, splitting into individual branches on the right. Another big misunderstanding was searching for events on our home screen. Users could not immediately find where to search for events as they had to first search something through the search bar feature. We decided to move the events filter to the main page of the app next to “Trending” and “Recommended” to make it more accessible.</p>
							<p>Other feedback elements included distinguishing between resource types. To make it easier for the user to immediately determine what is an event, opportunity, or resource, we changed the background color so that it correlated to different resource types. Other small changes included swapping “Tagline” for “Bio” on the organization profile page, putting the “Recommended” and “Trending” filter buttons closer together on the home screen for increased efficiency, and adding a button that allows users to update their interests on their profile page. We also had some errors that were merely in making our prototype such as fixing links and icon consistency. Finally, for increased learnability we added an error message to the student sign-in page, letting users know they need to input a .edu email address.</p>
							<p>Some feedback we did not implement after careful consideration was swapping the location of the profile page link in the bottom navigation bar with the settings icon in the triple bar hamburger menu. We wanted to optimize efficiency of the user and think the profile page would be used a lot more frequently than the settings page, and therefore, is deserving of a more accessible place on the app. We also did not change the location of the notifications bell as we wanted to stay consistent with other social media applications.</p>
