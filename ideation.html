							<br><h3>Scenarios</h3>
							<u>Sahaja Stanford</u>
							<p>Sahaja knows about a small protest surrounding a company building in a wildlife reserve. She knows a quick way to share all the details and conveniently invite her friend Wendy. With lots of options to choose from, she picks the best for Wendy. Sahaja can personalize her invite while busy Wendy can easily see if she's free on Google Calendar. Sahaja also wants to share the opportunity with a student organization she's in. She can share the application with her friends via GroupMe! Over the coming days, Sahaja gets notifications if her friends accept or decline her invite. Sahaja successfully brings her friends to an event, taking action toward a good cause and encouraging them to exercise their voice more to make the world a better place.</p>
							<u>Wendy Wellesley</u>
							<p>Wendy is overwhelmed with her internship and summer classes. As vice president of Woman in Business, an on-campus organization, she tries to make time in her busy schedule to meet with the other members of the group at least once a week. However, Wendy struggles to participate in their discussions because she is not completely up-to-date about current events. This is due to the fact that she has little time to read the news, as the abundance of content on social media and the Internet is overwhelming.</p>
							<u>Mark Smith</u>
							<p>Mark is an undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. He usually checks the news only once in a while and has not been very active in social/political events. But earlier this semester he met a girl in his writing class who is really into environmental protection. Mark would like to try out for some of those events to impress the girl. Thus, he downloaded Our Voice, an app for college students to find out resources/opportunities about socio-political events and connect with people all in one place. After registering for an account with his Facebook, he went to the search button and searched for the tag “Environment.” He browsed the events and decided to attend a virtual conference about climate change held by a group he knew the girl was in, so he clicked into the event and clicked “RSVP.”</p>
							<br><h3>Design Rationale</h3>
							<hr />
							<u>Design 1</u>
							<p>The first design enables users to choose between a student and organization account, since only organizations will have the ability to publish events. In terms of learnability, there are several signifiers, including labeled buttons and a navigation bar at the bottom of the screen, which provides an overview of the features that are offered in the application. Each page is internally consistent, with the logo at the top and the navigation bar the bottom across all pages. Also, the interface makes use of various universal standard icons and past history/actions to ensure user memorability. In addition to signifiers, consistency between pages, and universal attributes, the opportunities and resources in the news feed section can be filtered to increase user efficiency. Lastly, this application will leave users satisfied because they can separate their personal lives from their political ones and feel motivated to take action through badges and measurements such as actions taken.</p>
							<u>Design 2</u>
							<p>This design especially focuses on “Groups” - an important kind of entity in the app. Any user can create a group and invite people to join, and any group can post events and articles. Users can join groups in two ways: submitting a request or accepting an invitation. Existing organizations can join the app by creating a group and being verified. Every group must have a main mission statement. That will also serve as the core of the mind map for each group. The group owner can give certain users permission to edit the mind map, and editors can add/delete leaves from the mind map. The leaves can be categories, links to events/articles or users. The mind map feature is designed so that groups can keep resources collected and organized in a visual way, making it easier for users to find opportunities. Each group also has a feature called “Channels.” The main channel serves as a discussion forum for the whole group, and there can be personal channels for members. This eliminates the need for users to find another platform for communication.</p>

							<br><h3>Design Direction and Review Session Takeaways</h3>
							<u>Major Features to Keep</u>
							<p>Based on the feedback we received in class, we decided to take certain features and aspects from both of our preliminary designs and combine them for our design direction. From the first design, we continued with the option to choose between a student and organization account, which is a necessary feature that only enables organizations to publish events. We also chose to keep badges and action measurements as incentives for users to continue engaging with our application. We also chose to move the filter option to after users entered their search, which would prevent the top of the page from being overly cluttered with icons and thus improve user efficiency. From the second design, the groups and mind map concept received positive reception from the class, so we decided to integrate this into our design as well. We also decided to use several universal icons from this design, such as the search bar and triple bar logo, to ensure user memorability. The triple bar logo would drop down to enable users to access their settings, invite friends to events, and see their personal recent activity.</p>
							<u>Design Adjustments</u>
							<p>In order to implement features from both preliminary designs, we needed to adjust some of our design. Positive feedback included the badges and action measurements which would serve as a motivator for certain users. Another big piece of positive reception was the groups and mind map concept which was seen as original and helpful for the efficiency of a user learning. Our bottom navigation bar would be similar to the first design, with the addition of a groups section for our groups and mind map feature. At the top of the page, we decided to use a top navigation bar like the second design. However, it would differ from the original design in that notifications would no longer be under the triple bar feature so that users could gain easier access to their notifications. Furthermore, users would gain more satisfaction in seeing their notifications about badges, action measurements, and invites from the home page, as well as be able to see their notification history for memorability purposes. Lastly, under settings, users have the option to make multiple accounts and switch between them, similar to other social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. This would enable a leader of multiple organizations to create a personal account and several organization accounts. Overall, we felt that these design changes would maintain external consistency, as the placement of the features were similar to other prominent platforms and websites. </p>
