							<br><h3>User Interview Takeaways</h3>
							<p>After interviewing various users, we observed some trends in their responses and determined several takeaways. Most of the users were interested in becoming more involved with socio-political events and opportunities, but did not always have the time to do so. Some mentioned that COVID-19 made in-person protesting more inaccessible and risky. Although users did not feel protected enough to attend group gatherings, most of them were interested in remote opportunities. In addition, users noted that activism over social media had the following problems: “slack-tivism”, lack of separation between politics and personal life, and inaccurate information. Based on their responses, we were able to form a problem statement and start working toward a web application that could help students increase their mental and physical resilience during a time of pandemic and civil unrest. </p>

							<br><h3>Personas</h3>
                            <p>Our users are college students/activists who seek to educate themselves and connect with one another about social/political issues and get involved in making socio-political change, and organizations and nonprofits that can put out events. We drafted four personas: three students (Wendy Wellesley, Sahaja Stanford, and Mark Smith) and one organization leader (William Washington).</p>

							<br><h3>Task Analyses</h3>
                            <p>Our three task analyses were connecting with other users, creating an account, and sharing an opportunity with a friend, which can be depicted in the hierarchical structures below.</p>
							<hr />
							<br><h3>Domain Analysis</h3>
							<p>Our domain analysis focused on four domains: events, groups, people, and articles. The connectivity of the domains with significant features and users can be depicted in the graph below.</p>
